# probono-shortcode-plugin

A Wordpress plugin that provides a shortcode ([probono_catalog]) that allows someone to embed the probono catalog into a page/post/etc.

## Specific Partner Use

The numbers used for "cohort_id" and "partner_id" in the example above, will be provided by FPBM to relevant parties.

The "dark_mode" attribute, when "true", changes the colors so as to contrast well with sites that use dark backgrounds.
